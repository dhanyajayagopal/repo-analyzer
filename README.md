# Building a Repository Analyzer

In this project, I built a Repository Analyzer that helps developers understand and explore GitHub repositories. Here's how I did it:

## 1. Setting Up the Backend

First, I created a FastAPI-based backend:
- I set up a FastAPI application with CORS middleware to handle frontend requests
- I integrated OpenAI's API for intelligent code analysis
- I created services to handle repository management and code parsing
- I implemented endpoints for repository analysis and AI-powered code queries

## 2. Building the Frontend

Then, I developed a modern React-based frontend:
- I created a clean, minimalist UI with a responsive design
- I implemented a form to accept GitHub repository URLs
- I added loading states to provide feedback during analysis
- I built components to display repository analysis results
- I included a search feature to explore code elements

## 3. Adding AI Capabilities

Next, I enhanced the application with AI features:
- I integrated an AI query system to answer questions about the code
- I implemented a code parsing system to understand repository structure
- I added natural language processing to make code exploration more intuitive
- I created an interface for users to ask questions about their repositories

## 4. Features I Implemented

The final application includes:
- Repository analysis and visualization
- Code structure exploration
- AI-powered code understanding
- Search functionality for code elements
- Real-time repository status updates
- Error handling and user feedback

## 5. Technologies Used

I built this using:
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, OpenAI API
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: Git, GitHub
- **API Integration**: REST APIs, CORS

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your environment variables (including OpenAI API key)
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to start analyzing repositories!
